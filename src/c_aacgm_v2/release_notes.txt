v2.4 Changes

+ 20170223
+ changed time.c and time.h to rtime.c and rtime.h to be consistent with RST
  distribution and to avoid any conflict with the standard time library.

Features:
+ 20170328
+ Added IGRF_Tilt() function to return IGRF dipole tilt angle.

+ 20160811
+ Added inverse MLT functions in order to get AACGM-v2 magnetic longitude
  from MLT

Bug fixes:

+ 20170601
+ added logic to MLT-v2 functions to allow them to set AACGM-v2 date/time
  and interpolate coefficients under the following conditions:
    1. the AACGM-v2 date/time is not set
    2. the date/time passed into the MLT-v2 function differs by > 30 days
  In each case the AACGM-v2 date/time is set to the values passed into the
  MLT-v2 function. Note that this will change the AACGM-v2 coefficients that
  are being used on subsequent calls _if_ the date/time is not reset.

+ 20170531
+ added 1900 to years in SetNow() function in order for it to work correctly

+ 20160816
+ added check for mlon input being NaN and returning NaN if so
