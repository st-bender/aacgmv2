v2.6 Changes

Features:

+ 20191228 added AACGM-v2 coefficients derived using IGRF13 model. Note that
                 
                 Note that there are some small differences (less than 1 km)

           added file magmodel_1590-2020.txt which contains GUFM1 and IGRF13
                 coefficients

           added additional checks in igrflib.c for reading new coefficients.
                 Note: igrf13coeffs.txt had an additional space at the end of
                       each line that required these additional checks.

           changed error message in aacgmlib_v2.c for date/time out of bounds

Bug fixes:


v2.5 Changes

Features:

+ 20180508 added AACGM-v2 coefficients for 1590-1895.
           added functionality to use these coefficients and tracing
           added file magmodel_1590-2015.txt which contains GUFM1 and IGRF12
                 coefficients

+ 20180614 allow "silent" keyword in AACGM_v2_GetDateTime() DLM (used in
                 mlt_v2 IDL version), but is ignored since that would require
                 an additional argument in the C function, further complicating
                 backward compatibility.

Bug fixes:

+ 20170710 added initialization to err variable in MLTConvert_v2 function.

+ 20180430 renamed pause() to igrf_pause() to avoid conflict

+ 20180430 fixed bug in RK45 for RK4 solution. Moved resetting xyz inside else
           for adaptive stepsize solver.

+ 20180614 fixed oversight bug in inv_MLTConvert_v2() to check for a date that
           differs from the AACGM date by more than 30 days and recomputes
           AACGM coefficients if necessary. Now consistent with MLTConver_v2().
